# //// With Claude Pulling the words from words_alpha.txt , asking if the word is an object or not, if yes it saves it to verified_words.json and defines the verified word and saves the word and its definition to defined_words.json
## Next algorithm is only using the verified_words.json file
###Â PROBLEM - It only finds the objects, but asphalt is not an object and still used in friction problems.
